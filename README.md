# cellranger-docker

This is a fork of [koash/cellranger-docker](https://github.com/koash/cellranger-docker) aimed at creating a Docker container with an up-to-date version of CellRanger.

I did not touch the original Dockerfile when it comes to the base image for the container.

|Label|Name|Version|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Software|Cell Range|3.0.1|
|Base image|CentOS|7.3.1611|
|Docker container|cellranger-docker|3.0.1|

## Cell Ranger

Cell Ranger is a set of analysis pipelines that processes Chromium single cell 3â€™ RNA-seq output to align reads, generate gene-cell matrices and perform clustering and gene expression analysis.
